SVG optimization within Emacs with SVGO

This package uses the Node utility https://github.com/svg/svgo[SVGO] to optimize SVG files. It provides a command to reduce the size of the SVG contents in the current Emacs buffer.

== Installation

To install this package you should use `use-package`, like so:

[source]
----
(use-package svgo
  :hook
  (nxml-mode . (lambda () (bind-key "M-o" 'svgo nxml-mode-map)))
  (image-mode . (lambda () (bind-key "M-o" 'svgo image-mode-map))))
----

Also make sure you have Node/NPM installed on your machine.

== Usage

image::svgo.gif[Demonstration of the svgo-mode]

After opening a SVG file in Emacs, you can execute `M-x svgo` or, with the key bindings configured as suggested above, press `M-o` to optimize the file (either in `image-mode` or after toggling the image display with `C-c C-c` in `nxml-mode`).

If the `svgo` NPM package is missing you will be prompted to automatically install it.
