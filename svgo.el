;;; Commentary:

;; This package uses the Node utility SVGO to optimize SVG files.  It
;; provides a command to reduce the size of the SVG contents in the
;; current Emacs buffer.
;;
;; To install this package you should use `use-package', like so:
;;
;; (use-package svgo
;;   :hook
;;   (nxml-mode . (lambda () (bind-key "M-o" 'svgo nxml-mode-map)))
;;   (image-mode . (lambda () (bind-key "M-o" 'svgo image-mode-map))))
;;
;; Also make sure you have Node/NPM installed on your machine.
